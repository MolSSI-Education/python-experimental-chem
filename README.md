# Python Scripting for Experimental Chemistry

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/MolSSI-Education/python-experimental-chem?editor=jupyter)

This repository contains notebooks first presented at the Southeast Regional Meeting of the American Chemical Society (SERMACS) 2023.
The notebooks are designed to introduce students to the basics of Python programming and how it can be used to analyze experimental data.
Particularly, the notebook shows data processing (peak finding, function fitting, background subtraction, integration) using packages from the scientific Python ecosystem.

In contrast to other workshops, the focus is primarly on data analysis and processing. 
Only a minimal amount of time is spent on the basics of Python programming (for example, loops and conditionals are not covered, since they are not needed for the subsequent data processing and analysis).
